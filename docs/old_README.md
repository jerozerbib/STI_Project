# STI Project

## Use case

### Linux OS

You have to install `php-sqlite3` in order to have the database access.

If you are running a Linux OS, you might want to try first to run the linux.sh script

```bash 
./linux.sh
```

What it does is basically essential in order to run the website. 
It gives the folder, and all the files wihtin, the `777` permissions. 
We did not find any other way to do it...

Then, use dock.sh 

```bash 
./dock.sh
```

### Mac OSx

First check if `php-sqlite3` and, run the dock.sh

```bash 
sh dock.sh
```

Now there are 4 accounts. admin, lio, jere and jee, jee has low rights. The password for each account is the pseudo.

The users have the pair `username/passord` as follows : 

admin : admin/admin
lio : lio/lio
jere : jere/jere
jee : jee/jee

To have all permissions, you need to have the field "roles" equal to "admin".

You can try the app    http://localhost:8080

You can generate a new database with a php script in /site/database/ 

```php sti_db.php```


### Side note

If a user is deleted, all received messages are also deleted frome the database.
Therefore, the sender will see the message but not the the recepient's name.
This info cannot be restored if the same user is created.
